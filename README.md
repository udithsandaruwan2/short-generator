# short-generator
This Python-based video automation tool generates engaging AI-powered storytelling videos. It uses Pexels stock footage, Whisper for audio transcription, gTTS for voiceovers, and MoviePy for video editing. The result is a vertical or horizontal YouTube-ready video with voice and subtitles â€” created entirely from a text input.
